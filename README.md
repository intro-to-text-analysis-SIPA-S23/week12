# Week 12: Text analysis: Topic Modeling
This week, we will learn how to use topic modeling to quickly parse out the primary topics across a collection of text files. Topic modeling can help ​​identify clusters of words that show up together in statistically meaningful ways throughout a corpus of text. We will use the Tomopy Python library for topic modeling. 

- Topics covered: 
    - What is Topic Modeling?
    - What are practical applications of Topic Modeling?
    - How to perform Topic Modeling with newspaper data?
    - How to use this method with other text data sources?
- Curriculum for this session:
    - Melanie Walsh, _Introduction to Cultural Analytics_, [Topic Modeling Overview](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/05-Text-Analysis/06-Topic-Modeling-Overview.html) & [Topic Modeling with Tomopy](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/05-Text-Analysis/09-Topic-Modeling-Without-Mallet.html)
- Assignments due before class:
   - Work through the curriculum for the upcoming week's session in a Jupyter Notebook. Download your Jupyter Notebook as "ipynb" file (Go to "File", "Download as", "Notebook (.ipynb)"), and [upload](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) the file to the weekly GitHub assignment link.
        -  You are welcome to use the dataset provided in the curriculum link or use a dataset of your choice.
